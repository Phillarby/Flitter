			For my competition submission I have created an interactive application called Flitter. Flitter consumes the Twitter streaming API and uses hash-tags and tweets to create an interactive, real-time visualisation of social activity. 
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>NOTE: this is a self-signed jar file, and you will need to accept the security warning to be able to view this web-embedded version of Flitter. The app can be run directly from the flitter.jar file, which will not require acceptance of the security warnings and I have found this often give better performance and a smoother user experience than the web-embedded version.</b>
